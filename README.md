## 📌 Overview  

This project predicts **Bear Ball exercise types** and counts the **number of repetitions** performed by a user in real-time.  

It focuses on 5 major Bear Ball exercises (e.g., Squat, Row, etc.) and uses **machine learning models** to classify the exercise being performed with high accuracy.  

The system is designed to assist in **fitness monitoring and performance analysis**, making workouts smarter and trackable.
